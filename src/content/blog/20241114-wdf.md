WDF is object based, the objects have to be created and manipulated by function calls to WDF itself.

WDF objects are used by handles! Not their ptr to kernel structure. But for sure they’re backed by a kernel structure (Obviously).

Each WDF object has a lifecycle requirement. See https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/wdf/framework-object-life-cycle.

Notable characteristics of a framework objects is:

- Reference counter
    - Bruh a reference counter.
- Context space
    - Essentially custom data.
- Deletion callback functions
    - For framework objects, there may be attached to some external resource (e.g. memory allocation in context space that needs to be freed by the driver developer). Since WDF manages object lifecycle, it has to have a mechanism to request driver to release resources for object pending deletion.
- Parent object
    - WDF object is organized as a tree of object, with parent-child relationship. When parent is deleted, the framework automatically deletes children.

# Objects

ReactOS has implementation of WDF, which is great since they build doxygen!

https://doxygen.reactos.org/d6/d44/classFxObject.html

As visible from above, all WDF object inherits from a base class called `FxObject` from Wdf0100.

FxObject has a `m_Type` field, using this field you can quickly find out what type to cast the WDF object to investigate.
